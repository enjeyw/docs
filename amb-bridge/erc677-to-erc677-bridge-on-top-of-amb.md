# ERC677 to ERC677 bridge on top of AMB



This manual describes how to deploy the pair of ERC677-compatible tokens and the bridge mediator contract to relay assets between two chains by using Arbitrary Message Bridge \(AMB\).

The steps below assume that the AMB is up and running and serves the bridge between Kovan \(Foreign\) chain and Sokol \(Home\) chain. The addresses of bridge contracts are mentioned [here](https://docs.tokenbridge.net/amb-bridge/how-to-use-cryptokitties-bridge#deployed-amb-bridge-contracts).

1. `git clone https://github.com/poanetwork/tokenbridge-contracts.git`
2. `git checkout 3.2.0`
3. Create an empty `deploy/.env` file by `touch .env`
4. `docker-compose up --build`
5. `docker-compose images bridge-contracts`
6. `docker cp contracts_bridge-contracts_1:/contracts/flats ./`
7. Deploy the contract `ERC677BridgeToken` from `flats/ERC677BridgeToken_flat.sol` by Remix or MyEtherWallet to the Foreign chain. In the steps below we assume that the address of the deployed token contract is `0x1e402513B7305F758476409da8048fd5b045C0AA`
8. Verify the contract in the block explorer \(contract name: `ERC677BridgeToken`, compiler version: `v0.4.24+commit.e67f0147`, optimization is enabled, automatic identification of constructor arguments\)
9. Mint some amount of tokens for an account
10. Prepare `deploy/.env`

11. `docker-compose run bridge-contracts deploy.sh`. It outputs something like this:

    ```text
    {
        "homeBridge": {
            "address": "0xFaD73D79952041332554e11d896F430a2ecA1Fa8",
            "deployedBlockNumber": 11969756,
            "erc677": {
                "address": "0xAFb605e4463D1326249075b3367A3353DeA34a6D"
            }
        },
        "foreignBridge": {
            "address": "0x1a2546B27293e127fF9a3d0D71A43Dd3733fa1F7",
            "deployedBlockNumber": 15083043
        }
    }
    ```

12. Verify the token contract `0xAFb605e4463D1326249075b3367A3353DeA34a6D` on the Home side by using `flats/ERC677BridgeToken_flat.sol` \(contract name: `ERC677BridgeToken`, compiler version: `v0.4.24+commit.e67f0147`, optimization is enabled, automatic identification of constructor arguments\)
13. Verify the mediator contract `0xFaD73D79952041332554e11d896F430a2ecA1Fa8` on Home side
    * verify the proxy contract by `flats/EternalStorageProxy_flat.sol` \(contract name: `EternalStorageProxy`, compiler version: `v0.4.24+commit.e67f0147`, optimization is enabled, no constructor arguments\)
    * go to the implementation contract from the _Read Contract_ tab
    * verify the implementation contract by `flats/amb_erc677_to_erc677/HomeAMBErc677ToErc677_flat.sol` \(contract name: `HomeAMBErc677ToErc677`, compiler version: `v0.4.24+commit.e67f0147`, optimization is enabled, no constructor arguments\)
14. Verify the mediator contract `0x1a2546B27293e127fF9a3d0D71A43Dd3733fa1F7` on Home side
    * verify the proxy contract by `flats/EternalStorageProxy_flat.sol` \(contract name: `EternalStorageProxy`, compiler version: `v0.4.24+commit.e67f0147`, optimization is enabled, no constructor arguments\)
    * go to the implementation contract from the _Read Contract_ tab
    * verify the implementation contract by `flats/amb_erc677_to_erc677/ForeignAMBErc677ToErc677_flat.sol` \(contract name: `ForeignAMBErc677ToErc677`, compiler version: `v0.4.24+commit.e67f0147`, optimization is enabled, no constructor arguments\)
15. Execute `transferAndCall` method from the token contract on the Foreign side by using NiftyWallet, MyEtherWallet or Remix. The argument `to` for the call must contain the address of the mediator contract `0x1a2546B27293e127fF9a3d0D71A43Dd3733fa1F7`. The `data` argument must be `0x`. The sender of the transaction is the account-recipient used in the mint operation. Make sure:
    1. the amount of tokens must be equal or greater the `FOREIGN_MIN_AMOUNT_PER_TX` parameter used in the deployment
    2. the transaction verified successfully and included into a block.
16. Check the balance of the sender on the Home side.
